# Forward log messages containing the substring "key=\"siem-" to a remote syslog server

# If a log message contains "key=\"siem-", take the following action:
:msg, contains, "key=\"siem-" @10.10.10.10; t_os
& ~
#example ip address
# Terminate further processing for this log message to avoid redundant actions

# /etc/rsyslog.conf

# Set the default logging rules
*.*    /var/log/syslog

# Log messages from the mail subsystem
mail.*    -/var/log/mail.log

# Log messages from the cron subsystem
cron.*    /var/log/cron.log

# Log messages from the auth subsystem
auth.*    /var/log/auth.log

# Log kernel messages
kern.*    -/var/log/kern.log

# Log messages from user processes with a priority of 'info' or higher
user.*    /var/log/user.log

# Log emergency messages to a separate file

# Uncomment the following line to stop logging messages to console

*.* @10.10.10.10:514
#This line instructs rsyslog to forward all log messages (*.*) to a remote syslog server at IP address 10.10.10.10  on port 514 using the default UDP transport protocol.


#$ModLoad imuxsock: This line loads the imuxsock module, which provides support for reading messages from the system's socket interface. It allows rsyslog to collect log messages from local processes.

#$ModLoad imjournal: This line loads the imjournal module, which enables rsyslog to read log messages from the system journal. The system journal is managed by systemd-journald, and this module allows rsyslog to integrate with the journal to collect log data.

#$ModLoad imfile: This line is commented out (indicated by #). If uncommented, it would load the imfile module, which allows rsyslog to read log messages from text files.

#$WorkDirectory /var/lib/rsyslog: This sets the working directory for rsyslog, where it may store some temporary files or state information.

#$ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat: This sets the default template for log file actions. RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat is a predefined template that formats log messages in a way similar to traditional syslog.

#$IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf: This line is commented out. If uncommented, it would include additional configuration files from the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory. This is a common practice to keep the main configuration file cleaner by placing specific configurations in separate files.

#$OmitLocalLogging on: This setting instructs rsyslog to omit logging messages generated locally by itself. It helps prevent recursive logging loops.

#$IMJournalStateFile imjournal.state: This specifies the state file for the imjournal module. This file keeps track of the current position in the journal, allowing rsyslog to resume reading from where it left off.

#$EscapeControlCharactersOnReceive on: This setting enables the escaping of control characters on message reception. It's a security measure to prevent malicious log messages from causing issues when processed by rsyslog.
